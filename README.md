# ToolbarExpandHeightDemo

 In my case i need expand the height of the toolbar, and we want the button to be vertical in center of this toolbar, like this,
 
 <img src="/captures/expect.png" width="300" alt="demo"/>
 
 but unfortunately we get the view like this:
 
 <img src="/captures/normal.png" width="300" alt="demo"/> 
 
 i found that the Toolbar has a buttonGravity api, but i can only set TOP or BOTTOM, i hope i can set it to CENTER_VERTICAL.
